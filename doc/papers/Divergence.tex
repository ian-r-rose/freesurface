\subsection{Continuity equation}

$\nabla \cdot \rho u = 0$
assuming only changes in density in the vertical direction this can be written as,
$\nabla \cdot u + \frac{1}{\rho_{r}} \frac{\partial \rho_{r} }{\partial z} u_{z}= 0$
which can be expressed in terms of $P$, the pressure as,
$\nabla \cdot u + \frac{1}{\rho_{r}} \frac{\partial P }{\partial z} u_{z} g= 0$ \\
For the benchmark case we have a functional expression for the density $\rho_{r}$ \\
$\rho_{r}(z) = \bf e{\beta(1-z)}$ with $\beta = Di/\gamma = K$ the bulk modulus. (in our case 2.0)
that means that we have to put this functional description of $\rho_{r}(z)$ in our contribution to the lower left of block of the stiffness matrix.
