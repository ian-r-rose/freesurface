\section{CheckImplementation}
We have to make sure that our results are reproducable.
For that we use the Tan Gurnis benchmark but we will also redo all model runs with our own FE implementation.\\
This way we are sure that we produce mode results that are free of model specific artefacts.\\
To this end we will run the Jacobs model first in a simple Bosinesq approximation (BA).\\
I commented out visoucs heating internal heating and adiabatic compression for these experiments.\\
To verify the model we will compare the model outcome of dealii for three parameters.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Root mean square velocity $\int_{Omega} \sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2})/ int_{Omega}$
\item Mean temperature
\item Nusselt Number
\end{enumerate}
